# AirportModeller

This is a html/css/javascript application to display aircraft tracks to an airport

It pulls from a datafile (arrival time, departure time, locations, etc.) and then draws the tracks to the screen

the world is modelled in 3-d and the Flight Information Boundaries are displayed

Notes - no external javascript libraries, all scripts are hand created

the timing, and many of the display features are not yet functional
